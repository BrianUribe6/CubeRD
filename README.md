# CubeRD

CubeRD is a Rubik's Cube Solver and timer that implements opencv's template recognition and kociemba's algorithm for optimally solving the popular Rubik's Cube puzzle.  Users can take a picture of all the faces of the cube, and get a near-optimal step-by-step solution within seconds. Additionally, for  experienced speed cubers we have included a timer that contains all the features you would expect from a competitive timer: scrambles, averages, history of all solves, penalties such DNF/ +2, and much more.
